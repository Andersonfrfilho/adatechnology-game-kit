A shot breaks a brick or a concrete block where it lands instead of knocking the whole unit out: a crater a few centimetres across goes through the unit (about 6 cm for a pistol round, 10 for a rifle round), the rest of the unit stays, and small bits of the inside of the material fly out of both faces, most out of the far one. The rest of a unit comes out, in pieces, only once its craters took most of it. A wall, a partition or a column now loses its section across one height, so a slot shot along the base of a wall brings it down while the same rounds spread over its face leave it standing. The house renderer draws each crater as an irregular hole through the unit with the plaster broken off around it, and the marks of a shot (bullet holes, spalls) now sit on the face as drawn, not a few millimetres behind it.

A pistol round on a plastered brick wall no longer draws a star of cracks and a flat orange disc: the plaster comes off in a ragged patch drawn by the house renderer, with the brick and its mortar under it and the bullet hole on the brick (the destruction renderer leaves its patch out on meshes marked `userData.drawnSpalls`). The destruction renderer also keeps ranges another drawing collapsed (`userData.collapsedRanges`) when it rewrites a merged mesh, so a broken wall comes back after a reset.
