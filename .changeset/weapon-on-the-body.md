The weapon in the hands is the body's own, at its real size, in first and third person: no first-person scale-down and no offset in front of the camera. `holdFrame` (the pocket of the right shoulder) now answers in both views, and a host with no body gets the same pocket under the camera's eye. A gun with no stock slides forward so its grip is never behind the eye, a short two-hand gun is held at mid-chest, the grips of both hands stay above the bottom of the view (`HAND_IN_VIEW`, up to 0.3 m) and the weapon comes back from a wall (`WALL_PULL`, up to 1.2 m). The generic props ride the body too. The player's body no longer stops the weapon's contact and laser rays. The support arm's elbow tucks under the gun, so the forearm meets the handguard at 47 to 51 degrees off the aim.
