Rigid ground cracks: concrete, asphalt, tile and stone open a star of lines around a bullet, a hammer or a blast, reaching with the cube root of the energy (about a metre from a grenade on a slab, half that on asphalt), kept in snapshots and drawn as one mesh (`TerrainMaterial.crack`, `Terrain.cracks`, `crackLines`).
A contact charge breaks a rigid layer right through once it has enough for its thickness cubed (about 1 kg of TNT for a 12 cm reinforced slab), baring the bars, which take the same blow and let a slab over a void drop (`TerrainMaterial.breach`, `TerrainBlowResult.breached`).
