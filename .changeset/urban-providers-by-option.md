`game-urban` has two new optional options (spec 005, D1 and D7): `createVehicleProvider({ ids })` and `createPlantProvider({ pickSpecies })` take the fleet and the species by option. Without them nothing changes: `ids` still defaults to `PARKED_VEHICLE_IDS` and the species still come from the `region` table of `game-vegetation-species`. The default is deprecated and will be removed in the next major; `PARKED_VEHICLE_IDS` and `region` are `@deprecated` too. Recommended path: `defaultUrbanProviders()` of `@adatechnology/game-kit-defaults`, or your own `ids` and `pickSpecies`.

`game-urban-three`: `createPlantResolver({ toSpec })` and the `providers` and `plantSpec` options of `createUrbanTestModule` are new and optional; the defaults (`toSpec` of `game-vegetation-species`, the providers of `game-urban`) are deprecated and will be removed in the next major.
