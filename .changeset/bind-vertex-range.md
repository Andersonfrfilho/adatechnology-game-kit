`bind` can now draw a part by a vertex range of a merged mesh: `BindOptions.parts` values also accept `{ mesh, range: [v0, v1] }` (new exported type `MeshRange`, alone or in an array with plain meshes). Dents, char and heat colours (through vertex colours), melt and hole/crack decals apply only to that range. When the part detaches, collapses (the renderer now also splits loose groups on `collapse` events) or breaks, its faces are extracted into a new mesh for the loose piece and the range is collapsed in the merged mesh; `restore` and `clear` bring everything back. Invalid ranges throw from `bind`.
