The test room shares one effects world (T5.1g). It creates a single `createVfxRenderer` (screen overlay in the container), passes its world to the destruction renderer, lends it to every module as `host.effects`, steps it once per frame, wraps its render in `applyCamera` (new `TestRoom.applyCamera()` for hosts that render themselves) and counts its pools in the `particles` metric. Grenades, rockets and charges play the profile of their explosive (`vfx.world.explosion(explosive, point, { direction })`; the destruction renderer keeps only the shove and the sound), and the `explosion` host event carries `explosive` (also for parts that blow up, from `explodes.effect`). New option `craters` replaces the floor with a deformable ground patch that big explosions dig into (default off). `game-weapons-three`: the explosives it puts in the world (fuel barrel, propane cylinder, car tank) name their effect in `explodes.effect`, so their blast is the explosive's profile.
