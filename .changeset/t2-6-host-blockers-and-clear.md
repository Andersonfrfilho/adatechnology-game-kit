`ModuleHost.addBlocker(blocked)`: a module with walls of its own (a house) keeps the walking player out of them; the function is asked on every step with the player's radius and may follow a door that opens. `ModuleHost.onClear(listener)`: a module that put things in the world on its own follows the room clearing its area (`clear()`, opening an area, scenarios) to take them away. Both optional; the room lends them.
