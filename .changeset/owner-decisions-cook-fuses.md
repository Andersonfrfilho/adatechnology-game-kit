Cooking a grenade: a throwable with a timer fuse takes the pin out on the pull and is thrown on `release(origin?, direction?)`, which now returns the throw with the fuse that is left (`WeaponState.release` returns `TriggerResult | null`, and `WeaponState.cooking` says a pin is out); holding past the fuse sets it off in the hand (`Use` `throw` with `inHand`, and `cooked` for the seconds held). Impact, remote and wire throwables, and a long-fuse dynamite, still act on the pull. The rule emits `{ type: 'cook', phase: 'start' | 'throw' | 'burst', fuse }`.

BREAKING for exhaustive switches over `HostEvent`: the test room reports the same `cook` event to modules, and `toolAnimationStep` maps it to the new `TOOL_CLIP.COOK` clip (started with the fuse as `duration`, finished on throw or burst). The room throws what is being cooked on release (and when the tool changes).

Fuses: `ExplosiveDef` gains `fuseRange` (sampled per throw from a stream of its own, so the spread is not moved: the flashbang is the M84 delay of 1.0 to 2.3 s) and `fuseLength` with `burnRate` and `burnTolerance` (the dynamite is 0.03 m of safety fuse at 131 s/m ±10%). `WeaponState.setFuseLength(metres)` and the area's `fuse_length` control set a longer one; from `rules.explosives.placeFuseFrom` (10 s) the explosive is set down lit instead of thrown. `nominalFuse` and `sampleFuse` are exported, and `checkArsenal` reports a bad fuse number.
