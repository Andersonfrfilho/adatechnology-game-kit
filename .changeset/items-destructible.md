`buildItem` takes `destructible: true`: each mesh gets the `game-destruction` material of its kit tag (`DESTRUCTION_MATERIAL_BY_TAG`), and models listed in `data/destruction.json` (the three cans) are hollow shells welded to one another with their label as a skin. The items test area draws its items that way. `specFromObject3D` understands `userData.destructionSkin` (such a mesh stays on the part it overlaps and never becomes a part of its own) and `root.userData.destructionMass` (the real weight, split between the parts); `buildItem` passes the item's `weight` that way.
