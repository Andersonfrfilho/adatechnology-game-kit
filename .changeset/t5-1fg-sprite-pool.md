One sprite pool for the whole kit (T5.1f-g, spec 001). `game-vfx` gets `vfx.burst(kind, point, normal, count, speed?, options?)`, `vfx.spawn(...)`, `vfx.onLand(owner, fn)` and `vfx.sprites()` over 14 kinds (`data/sprite-kinds.json`, `patchSpriteKinds`; the numbers and the generator are the ones of the old `particles.ts`), with `floor` and `rise` spawn options; `game-vfx-three` draws them in two layers (`vfx-sprites-additive`, `vfx-sprites`). `game-destruction-three` and `game-fluids-three` delete their own `particles.ts` and use the pool (`ParticleKind` stays as an alias of `SpriteKind`; `FluidRendererOptions` gets `vfx` and `camera`; the destruction renderer plays the effects of the Phase 2 events through `eventEffects`, default `EVENT_EFFECTS_MAP`). `game-weapons-three` plays the muzzle flash and the casing of a shot seen from outside through `host.effects` (`muzzle_glock|ak|r870|barrett`, `casing_brass|shell|50`, by case type, in `data/world-effects.json`); the `shot` host event of `game-contracts` carries optional `origin` and `direction`, and the effect sink falls back from explosions to the Workshop recipes (`param` by index or id).
