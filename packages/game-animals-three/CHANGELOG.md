# @adatechnology/game-animals-three

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- df42f4b: Every builder of the kit marks what it draws with its origin (`markKitOrigin`, `kitOriginOf`, `unmarkedDrawings` of `game-contracts`): a car of the fleet, a house or wall, a piece of furniture, a person, an animal, a plant, an item (and whether it is still a stand-in shape), a weapon, the street, effects and the room. The test room lists its modules (`room.modules()`), and `tools/kit-audit/scene.mjs` opens each area and fails on anything drawn on the spot instead of coming from the SDK that owns it.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 945d00d: A loading indicator for any slow job of the test room: `room.loading` / `room.busy(label, work)` / `room.openAreaAsync(area)` (spinner or bar, text in the room's locale, nothing drawn with `ui: false`), the generic `BusySink` contract and `ModuleHost.loading`, `ModuleControl.slow` and `TestableItem.slow` so the room's panel and catalogue run a slow press or spawn behind it, and `LOADING_CSS` / `loadingMarkup` for a page's first frame. The house bench rebuilds, the nursery lot, the walker, the crowd, the skins and the vehicles use it.

### Patch Changes

- fcd0be6: The weapon models, the animals and the characters draw their geometry with game-shapes (`shapeGeometries(host)`), with the same bytes as before (exact goldens of 367, 27 and 281 cases). game-weapons-three no longer depends on game-props3d. The IIFE builds of game-props3d, game-interactables-three and game-weapons-three bundle game-shapes. `shapeGeometries` of a namespace it made gives it back.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a41fcb7: The voices and the animal calls on `game-audio` (T6.1g). `game-characters-three` gets the sound bank of the bodies, 16 recipes whose traces equal the team code (the game's `grito` and `voz`, the art scene's `voice` behind groan, scream and leap, plus inhale, grab, bite, hurt, flesh, sever and gore), the table of the voices of the 13 undead types (`UNDEAD_VOICES`) and `createCharacterSound(host.audio)` (voices by moment, `body` events, what the player hears, the screamer's wind-up). `game-animals-three` gets the four calls of the game's `bichoSom` and `createAnimalSound` with the page's cooldowns. Both test areas play on the room's engine (new actions `voice`, `special_call` and `call`). `game-audio` exports the art scene's primitives (`sceneNoise`, `sceneTone`, `sceneVoice`, `sceneRecipe`); `game-destruction-three` uses them instead of its own copy (same recipes).

### Minor Changes

- 50eee43: Novo `@adatechnology/game-animals-three` 0.1.0 (spec 001, T4.3b e T4.4b): porte literal dos construtores dos Bichos do Vale (`quad`, `bird`, `snake`) e da animação, com os visuais vivo, infectado e morto para as 13 espécies, as vistas de juntas e aberta, e o módulo de teste `createAnimalsTestModule` (`?area=animals`). O `game-props3d` ganha `createNodeSkin` e `collectReferencedNodes`: uma malha de GPU que representa uma árvore inteira de peças, para muitos bichos numa chamada de desenho.
