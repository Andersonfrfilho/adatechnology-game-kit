# @adatechnology/game-terrain

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 53babb5: A scenario of the test room does the same whatever ran before it: the reset before each scenario puts every random stream, seed counter and clock back to its start.

  - `game-destruction-three`: `DestructionRenderer.reset()` (`clear` plus the renderer's random stream, the one that scatters the shove points of a blast, the fragments' stream and the clocks back to their seed and 0). Before, a blast after other scenarios pushed the loose items from other points, and the grenade's camp table could end up moving towards the blast.
  - `game-contracts`: `ModuleHost.onReset`, for a module to put its own streams, seed counters and clocks back when the host returns to its seeded start.
  - `game-test-room`: the reset before each scenario calls `renderer.reset()` and the modules' `onReset`.
  - `game-characters-three`: the test module's random stream, body seeds and animation clock start again on `onReset`.
  - `game-terrain`: clearing the marks starts their numbering again.

- 32529a1: A reset ground digs the same crater and throws the same clods as a new one: `reset` (and `setLayout`) start the ground's random stream over, and the clods count their ids from one again. Before, every reset went on from where the last blow left the stream, so the test room's scenarios that dig the floor came out different from one run to the next (`house_two_pillars` failed now and then).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2961d53: Deformable ground: new `game-terrain` and `game-terrain-three` (height field with strata per column, digging by material and blow, marks under a budget, clods, fire). The test room's floor is now a terrain, and each area lays its own ground through `TestableModule.ground`. The room's `craters` option is gone: the floor always digs. Adds the catalogue materials `asphalt`, `sand`, `gravel`, `turf` and `mortar`.
- 1821647: Nothing stays hanging when the ground changes: `Terrain.onDeform` says where it changed, `DestructionRenderer.wakeRegion` wakes what slept there, thrown pieces at rest fall again. The ground goes on beyond the terrain, so what is thrown past the edge lands on something.
- 6d15aad: Bare rebar bends under blows and gives way; a slab over a void (`suspended_slab`) then opens onto the floor below.
