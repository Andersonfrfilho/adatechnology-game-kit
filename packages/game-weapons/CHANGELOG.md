# @adatechnology/game-weapons

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0604035: `ExplosiveDef` gets two optional blocks for a world explosive that is a pressure vessel: `leak` (`fluid`, `liters`, `pressurized`, `igniteDelay`, `hissSeconds`: what it holds and when a leak catches fire as a torch) and `shell` (`launchSpeed`, `trailSeconds`: what is left of it after the blast). `propane_p13` carries the Laboratório de Explosões values (24 l of gas, torch after 0.8 s, shell up at 13 m/s with a 1.8 s fire trail) and a mass of 28 kg (15 kg tare plus 13 kg of gas); `checkArsenal` validates them.
- 1b1d611: Per-caliber penetration table in `game-weapons` (`AMMO`, 50 loads, `arsenal.loadOf`, `weapon.setAmmoKind`, `ArsenalOptions.ammo`): per calibre and kind of round
  (fmj, hp, ap, buck, slug, birdshot, incendiary, tracer...) the core and jacket, the mass and speed when they differ, the energy and the millimetres of steel,
  concrete, brick and wood it goes through. The shot carries `ammo`, `penetration`, `incendiary` and `tracer`. `game-contracts`: `Hit.penetration`, `Hit.incendiary`,
  `Hit.tracer`, `Hit.ignition`, `shotExtras(shot, distance)` (the penetration scaled by the energy left) and `shotToHit` passes them. `game-destruction` reads
  `Hit.penetration` by material class (`MaterialDef.penetrationClass` / `penetrationScale`), keeps `Hit.piercing` as the energy-rule fallback and reads no calibre
  names: `PIERCING_BY_KIND`, `PIERCING_BY_CALIBER` and `piercingOf` are removed (breaking). `shoot` takes `{ penetration, piercing, ... }` or a bare piercing factor.
  `game-test-room` passes the round of the shot to the world.
- d610199: A normal bullet that goes through a fuel tank, a jerrycan or a gas bottle now only leaks; it no longer blows the tank up by itself. The leak lights with a spark of a
  hard round on steel, an incendiary or tracer round, a fire near (a burning part or fuel stain) or a blast, and then the usual fire and explosion run.
  `game-contracts`: `IgnitionRules`, `DEFAULT_IGNITION_RULES`, `resolveIgnitionRules`, `ignitionChance`, `fillFactor`, `sparkTargetFactor` (the container side: a fill curve where a full
  tank mostly leaks and a nearly empty one lights easiest, what a spark needs to strike, the fire near). `game-weapons`: `rules.ignition` (chance of the core and the jacket of the round,
  built from the ammo table, plus the flame of incendiary and tracer) and `ammoIgnition`; the shot carries `ignition`. `game-destruction`: `DestructionOptions.ignition`, the roll in the
  ballistic hit of a container of `gas` or `fuel`, fire near and blast. `game-vehicles`: `VehicleDestructibleOptions.fuel` (starting level) and `ignition`; the `E > 1500` rule that
  heated the tank is gone. `game-vfx`: `vehicle_leak` is now the leak without the fire and the blast, and `vehicle_leak_ignited` is the whole Garagem sequence. `game-vehicles-three`:
  `defaultEffectIds.leakIgnited`, asked when the tank catches fire.
- 011e17a: Drive first-person muzzle smoke and flash scale from per-weapon data profiles (`smokeless`, `black_powder`, `suppressed`, `none`). Add `propellant` to `CaliberDef`, `.45-70 Government (black powder)` (`45_70_bp`), `MUZZLE_SMOKE` and `muzzleSmokeOf({ caliber, weapon, suppressed })` in `game-weapons`, parameterize `viewmodel_muzzle_flash` in `game-vfx` with smokeless defaults, pass the resolved profile through `createEffects().muzzleFlash` and `viewmodel-events.ts` in `game-weapons-three`, and refine the hot-barrel smoke wisp into a thin rising thread.

  Add a `gallery` smoke profile (never chosen by default) and optional `driftSpread`, `riseSpread`, `sideSpread` and `lifeSpread` values so the recipe can still reproduce the Arsenal gallery's original muzzle smoke exactly.

  Cool the barrel closer to real life: `rules.heat.perShot` is lower (a rifle magazine no longer glows), and the new `rules.heat.visual` (`smokeFrom`, `smokeSeconds`, `glowFrom`, `glowSpan`) sets when the player sees the hot-barrel thread of smoke (only above `smokeFrom` and for `smokeSeconds` after the last shot) and the red glow. `GALLERY_HEAT` keeps the numbers the Arsenal gallery recorded.

### Minor Changes

- 76d15b6: Contrato do corpo vivo (fase 4): `body.ts` com `BodySlot`, `SegmentKind`, `BodyRegion` e `MISSING_BITS`; `Hit.mass`, `Hit.cut` e `Hit.part`; evento `body`; `ObjectState.body`. `Shot.mass` (gramas do projétil) sai das armas e `shotToHit` copia para o `Hit`. O `game-destruction` ganha o rótulo do evento `body` nos dois idiomas.
- afffd1b: Twelve generic weapons for the melee items of the real-world catalog: tactical knife, meat cleaver, hatchet, nail bat, iron pipe, pickaxe, sickle, police baton, cast iron skillet, improvised spear, chainsaw and recurve bow, with reach, noise and mass of the item. They come after the existing weapons, so the order and the recorded scenarios of the shipped ones are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- cc182c7: Contracts: `Thumbnail` (`svg` or `render`, with `yaw`, `pitch`, `distance` and `wear`) and `TestableItem.thumbnail`; the registry helpers `mergeById`, `applyPatches`, `removeIds`, `deepMerge` and the `DeepPartial` type now live here so every catalog package merges packs the same way. Interactables: `ItemDef.thumbnail` and a dependency on the contracts. Weapons: imports the helpers from the contracts (public API unchanged).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 86b68d7: 21 new weapons (data from `decisions.creations`, each number with its source and reason): `hk_mp5sd3` (integral suppressor), `fn_parafal`, `taurus_t4_civil`, `taurus_th380`, `mossberg_500_cruiser`, `hk_mp5k`, `hk_ump9`, `mini_uzi`, `hk_mp7a1`, `hk_g36`, `hk_g36k`, `hk_g36c` (integral 3x optic on the first two), `fn_m249`, `fn_minimi_para`, `fn_mag`, `rpk`, `sig_mpx`, `mg3`, `pp19_bizon`, `vz61` and `m134`, and the calibres `4_6x30` and `32acp`. The M134 has three modes (hand-held with a belt box, with the ammunition backpack, on a tripod), a rate range (`rpmRange`, 2000 to 6000, 3000 by default) and a barrel spin-up (`spin`). The GP-25 fits only AK weapons (not the SKS). A factory part that is subsonic with its parts on (the MP5SD3) has the subsonic effect in its base numbers. `game-weapons-three` draws them (two new builders: the M134 rotary barrels that turn with each shot, and the Bizon helical magazine), keeps the 77 gallery hashes and has its own golden for the new models; the weapons area has four columns of counters and the M134 on its tripod.
- 16c1453: Accessories and stocks, types first (T1.7.1). `game-weapons` gains `attachment-types` (`AttachmentDef`, `MountDef`, `StatModifier`, `FittedAttachment`, `StockDef`, `WeaponSnapshot`), the optional `WeaponDef.mounts`, `fitted` and `stock`, the phases `fit`, `stock` and `switch`, the rule events `attachment`, `toggle`, `stock` and `underbarrel`, and `TriggerResult.suppressed` (also on the `shot` event). Nothing existing changes.

  `game-contracts` gains the `HostEvent`s `attachment`, `toggle`, `stock` and `underbarrel` and the clips `TOOL_CLIP.STOCK` (variants `fold`, `unfold`, `collapse`, `extend`) and `TOOL_CLIP.TOGGLE` (`on`, `off`); `toolAnimationStep` maps `stock` and `toggle`. BREAKING for exhaustive switches over `HostEvent`. The test room reports the new events to modules.

  Data (T1.7.2): `data/attachments.json` (30 accessories: suppressors, brakes, optics, grips, bipod, lights, laser, magazines, barrels, sling, ammunition backpack, tripod, grenade launchers), generated by the catalog tool from the Arsenal §11 lines and `decisions.json`; `firearms.json` gains `mounts`, `fitted` and `stock` per weapon (from the Gallery options plus the muzzle `threads`, `mountNotes`, `stocks` and `integral` decisions) and the length with the stock in for the seven weapons the Arsenal sheet lacks.

  Rule (T1.7.3): `resolveLoadout` and `canFit` (with the `isCompatible` plugin), `WeaponState.fit`, `remove`, `toggle`, `setStock`, `setStance`, `snapshot` and `arsenal.restore`, `aimSeconds` and `mass`. Effects apply in the order set, add, mul with the factory parts taken back out (a weapon without changes runs exactly as before). A suppressed pull sets `TriggerResult.suppressed`; a home-made suppressor breaks at a shot drawn from a salted stream. New rules `rules.attachments` (fit seconds 2/15/30, switch seconds, speed of sound), `rules.aim` (`hipSpread` is 1 in the SDK: the Arsenal's ×6 is a configuration) and `rules.stock`; `ArsenalOptions` gains `attachments`, `patch.attachments`, `remove.attachments` and `isCompatible`. `TriggerResult.status` gains `busy` (an accessory or the stock is being worked on).

  Launchers under a barrel (T1.7.4): the accessories `m203`, `gp_25` and `ag36` name a launcher weapon (`category: 'launcher'`, `tags: ['underbarrel']`) added to `launchers.json`, with the new reload family `underbarrel` (`breech_open`, `round_in`, `breech_close`) and the explosive `vog_25`. A weapon with one fitted has `underbarrel` (a second `WeaponState` with its own ammunition, the M79 launcher rule), `underbarrelActive` and `useUnderbarrel(on)` (phase `switch`); `trigger` and `reload` go to the launcher while it is on and `drain()` carries its events. `ReloadFamily` and the launcher action `family` gain `underbarrel`.

  BREAKING for code that implements the interfaces (not for callers): `WeaponState` gains the required members `attachments`, `mass`, `aimSeconds`, `suppressed`, `stock`, `underbarrel`, `underbarrelActive`, `canFit`, `fit`, `remove`, `toggle`, `setStock`, `setStance`, `useUnderbarrel` and `snapshot`, and `Arsenal` gains the required `attachments`, `canFit` and `restore`; a fake or a wrapper of either has to add them. Taking off a launcher keeps its rounds for that accessory: fitting it again brings them back (grenades are conserved).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b3a5d99: Launchers, throwables and flamethrower with the rule of the team deliveries. A launcher returns the projectile (`throw` with `explosive`, `trigger: 'impact'`, `armDistance` 10 m) and the `backblast` (5 m, 19° cone); `arsenal.explosiveBody(use)` flies it with gravity, bounces, counts the fuse, arms by distance (a hit before it is a `dud`) and returns `detonate` with everything a host needs; `blastEffect` and `backblastEffect` say who is in the lethal or injury zone (cone of the Claymore, stun of the flashbang). Throwables follow their `ExplosiveDef` (fuse, fire, energy): the molotov now leaves fire of 4 m for 9 s instead of 1.5 m for 12 s. New throwables `flashbang`, `dynamite`, `c4` and `claymore` (`place` use for the last two). `ExplosiveDef` has `chain` (delays of the chain reaction of the world explosives) and the trigger `explosion`; `WeaponRules.explosives` holds gravity and bounce; `weapon.ts` is split into `weapon-core`, `weapon-commands`, `weapon-firearm` and `weapon` without change of behaviour.
- 9666008: Cooking a grenade: a throwable with a timer fuse takes the pin out on the pull and is thrown on `release(origin?, direction?)`, which now returns the throw with the fuse that is left (`WeaponState.release` returns `TriggerResult | null`, and `WeaponState.cooking` says a pin is out); holding past the fuse sets it off in the hand (`Use` `throw` with `inHand`, and `cooked` for the seconds held). Impact, remote and wire throwables, and a long-fuse dynamite, still act on the pull. The rule emits `{ type: 'cook', phase: 'start' | 'throw' | 'burst', fuse }`.

  BREAKING for exhaustive switches over `HostEvent`: the test room reports the same `cook` event to modules, and `toolAnimationStep` maps it to the new `TOOL_CLIP.COOK` clip (started with the fuse as `duration`, finished on throw or burst). The room throws what is being cooked on release (and when the tool changes).

  Fuses: `ExplosiveDef` gains `fuseRange` (sampled per throw from a stream of its own, so the spread is not moved: the flashbang is the M84 delay of 1.0 to 2.3 s) and `fuseLength` with `burnRate` and `burnTolerance` (the dynamite is 0.03 m of safety fuse at 131 s/m ±10%). `WeaponState.setFuseLength(metres)` and the area's `fuse_length` control set a longer one; from `rules.explosives.placeFuseFrom` (10 s) the explosive is set down lit instead of thrown. `nominalFuse` and `sampleFuse` are exported, and `checkArsenal` reports a bad fuse number.

- 9666008: Trip wire: `ExplosiveDef.tripwire` (`length`, `angleDeg`, `height`; default in `rules.explosives.tripwire`, 10 m ahead and 0.15 m above the charge, derived because no source gives the M18A1 kit length) is carried by the `place` use of a charge with the `wire` trigger (the Claymore), and `tripwireSegment(use)` gives the segment to stretch. The test room draws the wire (`charge_wire`), puts a marker (`charge_marker`) where any charge was set down and sets the charge off when a body (the player, an object of the room) crosses the wire; bodies already on the wire when it was set are let through until they step off. The Y key now fires only the charges for the remote detonator.
- 478c444: Real models and handling rules. `game-weapons` ships 79 real weapons with brand and measures (launchers and flamethrowers included; plus the 42 generic archetypes, which the models point to
  through `archetype`), 28 calibres, 17 explosives, all generated by `tools/weapons-catalog` from the team deliveries, and `createArsenal`
  takes `explosives`, `patch`, `remove`, `include`, `rules` and `strings` and reports every inconsistency at once (`checkArsenal`). The runtime gains
  per-weapon speed and noise, `timings` (draw, reload, empty reload, per round, manual cycle, clear), `draw()`, reload by kind with its steps
  (`RELOAD_STAGES`), `volley` and burst `roundTimes`, jams on their own random stream (`seed ^ 0x6a09e667`, so the spread of a seed does not change) with
  `clearFault()`, a safety, barrel heat, weapon condition and ammunition quality, the noise of a burst, a minimal launcher, and `drain()` for the events.
  Breaking: jams are on by default (`rules: { faults: false }` turns them off), `TriggerResult` has new fields, the calibre noise replaces the weapon noise
  of the archetypes, and `WeaponsStrings` has new keys. `game-test-room` passes `faults: false` for its arsenal until the clear key arrives, maps the weapon
  events to host events and fills `HostTool` `fault`, `safety` and `heat`. `game-weapons-three` lays only the archetypes on the counters (three counters
  hold 39 weapons) until the new layout.

### Patch Changes

- cd4aab5: `checkArsenal` (and so `createArsenal`) reports a `defaultCondition` or `defaultAmmoQuality` that the rules do not define, the rules patch ignores `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype` keys, and `weaponsLayout` throws when the weapons do not fit on the counters instead of stacking them on the last one.
- 462e8c6: Gunshot sound from the team game: `computeShotSound` (pure, no WebAudio) gives the sound class, gain, cutoff and duration from the calibre energy, the distance, a suppressor and indoors, using the game's class table and its distance muffling (`gain / (1 + d² × 0.004)`, `cutoff / (1 + d × 0.01)`, silent under 0.01). The game calibres sound exactly as in the game; the energy scales loudness, length and brightness around the class. Classes, curves, class picker and mechanical sounds are options of `createWeaponAudio(volume, options)`, and the noise is seeded (`seed`), so the same seed gives the same sound.

  New: `WeaponAudio.shotSound`, `mechanical(id)` (every `RELOAD_STAGES` id, `dry_fire`, `jam`, `safety_on`/`safety_off`, `clear_start`/`clear_end`...), `event(weaponEvent)`, `play(soundClass, volume, distance)`; `shot(energyJ, category, extras?)` takes the distance, suppressor and indoors. `game-weapons` exports `createRng`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1691ef2: New package `@adatechnology/game-contracts` (global `GameContracts`, no runtime dependencies): the destruction contract (`DestructibleImpl`, `IMPACT_CONTRACT`, `checkDestructible`, `checkHit`, hits, events, state), weapons (`Shot`, `Use`, `shotToHit`), fluids (`ContainerSpec`, `LiquidId`, `ItemUseDef`), item animations (`AnimationClipSpec`, `checkAnimation`) and the `TestableModule` a module hands the test room. The destruction, destruction-three, weapons, fluids and test-room packages depend on it and re-export the moved types, so existing imports keep working; their IIFE bundles now include the contracts. `game-test-room` gains `room.loadModule(module)` (items under the module group, scenarios as buttons, contract checks written to the log), `room.playAnimation` / `room.animations()` with an animations panel, and `TestRoomItem.impl` / `animations`. `game-destruction`: collapse events are computed after all losses (never for a broken part), brittle thin parts break from drops (`fragility`), and `checkDestructible` takes its material ids from the built-in table. `game-destruction-three`: `hardLanding` syncs the transform before the hit and `Piece.localCenter`. `game-fluids`: tap API (`addTap`, `setTap`, `removeTap`, `taps`, `tap` event).
- 5f99ace: Initial release (0.1.0): 18 real calibres and 45 generic weapon archetypes as data (firearms, melee, flame, heat, throwables, tools), a deterministic `WeaponState` runtime (magazines, fire modes, reload, spread and bloom, pellets, recoil, fuel) that produces `Shot`s and `Use`s, and an `en` / `pt-BR` locale table.
