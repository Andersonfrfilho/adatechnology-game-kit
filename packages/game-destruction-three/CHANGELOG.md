# @adatechnology/game-destruction-three

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bf68a04: A shot book tears into loose pages instead of slabs as thick as the book. New `MaterialDef.sheet` (thickness of one sheet; paper 1 mm): a `tear` part thicker than a few sheets comes apart as layers of thin scraps, a little askew, three in four marked `Fragment.inner` (pages) and the rest cover. New `visual.innerColor` (paper: cream) colours the inner scraps and the fibres a hit throws out. The renderer lets those thin scraps glide and flutter down before they settle flat.

### Patch Changes

- 692c098: Test room: C crouches (`crouch.keys` option) without also firing the held item's second use, Ctrl/Alt+key stay in the game while playing, closing the page asks first, and a "Full screen" button keeps the whole keyboard (Ctrl+W included). Player avatar: crouch pose and arm carrying angle. Destruction: leaks follow the moved object and hole decals sit on dented skins.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 8feb42f: An explosion shoves what is around it. `blastShove` (game-contracts) is the one rule, `min(maxSpeed, sqrt(2 * energy * coupling / mass)) * (1 - d / r)^2`, with every number in `BlastShoveOptions` (the room's `blastShove` option, lent to modules as `ModuleHost.blastShove`). The destruction renderer uses it for its pieces and, with `shoveable`/`onLoosened`, makes a heavy object that is not fixed a piece when a blast reaches it. The test room marks heavy, free items that way, and wraps an item whose builder scales the root so that its spec, box and mass are in metres (a can of beans was 0.7 m and 460 kg). The characters test area pushes its people and knocks them down. The explosives area has scenarios that measure the push of a P13 shot and a thrown M67.
- 642f290: `buildItem` takes `destructible: true`: each mesh gets the `game-destruction` material of its kit tag (`DESTRUCTION_MATERIAL_BY_TAG`), and models listed in `data/destruction.json` (the three cans) are hollow shells welded to one another with their label as a skin. The items test area draws its items that way. `specFromObject3D` understands `userData.destructionSkin` (such a mesh stays on the part it overlaps and never becomes a part of its own) and `root.userData.destructionMass` (the real weight, split between the parts); `buildItem` passes the item's `weight` that way.
- 8dc6775: Loose pieces and debris can be picked. Every mesh of a part now carries `userData.destructionPart` (part id) and `userData.destructionObject` (id of the world object it belongs to), including the meshes of a piece made by a collapse or detach and the mesh a vertex-range part gets when it leaves a merged mesh (they used to lose it). Fracture fragments, decals and ground stains carry `userData.destructionDebris = true` so a host can skip them in a raycast.
- bcf60c8: `specFromObject3D` reads `userData.destructionContains` (`{ fluid, liters }`) of a mesh onto the part it makes, so that part is a container: a hole through it emits a `leak`.
- d24de8a: Soil and foundations (T10 §8). `game-contracts`: `DestructibleSpec.soil` (`SoilProfile`, `SoilLayer`), `PartSpec.structure.pile` (`PileSpec`),
  `ObjectState.soil` (`SoilState`) and the `settle` event. `game-destruction`: soil classes with the NBR 6122 basic pressures (`SOILS`), footings as
  elastic-plastic springs (subgrade modulus of a rigid footing, safety 3), piles by Décourt-Quaresma (`pileCapacity`, `pileLength`), and the object as a
  rigid body on them with the 1/200 out-of-plumb and P-delta: it settles, a heavy building on soft soil sinks, leans and tips over, on piles to firm
  ground it holds; `buildFrame({ footing, raft, piles, soil })`; option `soil` (`SOIL_DEFAULTS`). Off unless a spec has `soil`. `game-destruction-three`:
  draws the settlement and tilt under a `destruction-soil` node. `game-floorplan-structure`: `toDestructibleSpec({ soil, foundation, piles, soils })`
  puts the house on a raft (with piles) or on footings under each wall (`RAFT_THICKNESS`, `PILE_AREA`).
- b3f1cf1: The first shot, hit or leak no longer stalls the frame: the renderers build the shader programs they would make on demand (`warmUpProbes()` of the destruction, effects and fluids renderers returns meshes of those materials, `WarmUpProbes` in the contracts) and the test room renders them once, again whenever the lights of the scene change (a program is keyed by the light counts, and a material that does not use lights keeps the program of the lights it was first drawn with). `TestRoom.warmUp()` does it on demand. Measured in the items test area with a pistol on a soda can: the first frames after the shot went from 201 and 106 ms with 3 new programs to 15 and 8 ms with none.

### Patch Changes

- 3ebc4d5: A dent is never silently invisible: when fewer than 3 vertices of a mesh fall inside the dent radius (a mesh coarser than the dent), `applyDent` widens the radius to 1.5 times the distance to the nearest vertex, so the nearest vertices are pushed in.
- 31e7483: A skin mesh (`userData.destructionSkin`: a label, a coat) now moves with the surface of the shell under it when the part is dented (nearest shell triangle, barycentric weights, `applyPartDent`), instead of being dented on its own grid, so the two meshes never cross whatever their vertex grids are.

  The dent of a part also uses one reach for all its meshes: `Visuals.dentReach` finds the radius that gives each mesh at least 10 vertices (and 1.5 times the distance to the nearest), the part takes the widest.

- 7b5efe4: `specFromObject3D` (and the renderer's part matching and piece measuring) now work in metres for a scaled root: the root's world scale is kept, only its position and rotation are removed. A model drawn in other units and shrunk with `root.scale` no longer gets an oversized destruction body.
- 5b1d53f: `DestructionWorld.vent(objectId, partId, { point?, normal?, diameter? })` opens a through opening in a container part like a valve does (a `leak` event, the level drops, no damage and no `hole` event; `Hole.vent` marks it) and `seal` closes it. A `heat` hit of 470 °C or more on a part that leaks flammable fluid lights the leak (a lighter or a torch held at a gas jet): it burns, or goes off by its `explodes.chain`. The renderer ends a leak when its opening is closed.

### Patch Changes

- a41fcb7: The voices and the animal calls on `game-audio` (T6.1g). `game-characters-three` gets the sound bank of the bodies, 16 recipes whose traces equal the team code (the game's `grito` and `voz`, the art scene's `voice` behind groan, scream and leap, plus inhale, grab, bite, hurt, flesh, sever and gore), the table of the voices of the 13 undead types (`UNDEAD_VOICES`) and `createCharacterSound(host.audio)` (voices by moment, `body` events, what the player hears, the screamer's wind-up). `game-animals-three` gets the four calls of the game's `bichoSom` and `createAnimalSound` with the page's cooldowns. Both test areas play on the room's engine (new actions `voice`, `special_call` and `call`). `game-audio` exports the art scene's primitives (`sceneNoise`, `sceneTone`, `sceneVoice`, `sceneRecipe`); `game-destruction-three` uses them instead of its own copy (same recipes).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f9e616: `createDestructionSound(engine)` registers the material sounds of the art scene (`glass`, `wood`, `thunk`, `ping`, `clang`, `chip`, `crumble`, `thud`, `hiss`, `boom`, `burst`, `crack`) and the game's `explosion_boom` in `@adatechnology/game-audio`, and maps the renderer's `onSound` keys through a replaceable table (`art_scene` or `game` style). The renderer sends `burn_end` when a part goes out or finishes burning, and `burn_loop` is the fire loop that rises with the parts in flames. `game-audio` is a dependency.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- aa2c014: `game-destruction-three` draws blasts and fires with the effects world (T5.1f). A new `RendererOptions.vfx` takes the world the host shares (stepped by the host's `VfxRenderer`); without it the renderer makes its own world and `game-vfx-three` layer and steps them in `update`, so existing callers keep working. An `explode` event plays `ev.effect ?? 'generic'` (the M67 scaled by `radius / 15`; an id the catalogue does not know falls back to it), the five old bursts and the point light are gone, and a burning part gets one `vfx.fire` that follows it and stops when the part stops burning. `explode(point, energy, radius, options?)` takes `{ effect, direction, visual }`; `visual: false` keeps only the shove and the sound. `RendererOptions.explosionLight` is removed (the light belongs to the effects world) and `RendererOptions.camera` is new. Debris, sparks, ash, steam, drips and leaks go through the shared sprite pool (see `t5-1fg-sprite-pool`).

  `game-destruction` gets `blastFrontSpeed` (default off): glass an explosion reaches breaks `distance / speed` seconds later, in `update`. The `explode` event now carries `effect` from `explodes.effect`.

  `game-vfx-three` names its puff, spark and glow meshes (`vfx-puffs`, `vfx-sparks`, `vfx-glows`) and draws blank mark textures when there is no DOM, so it runs headless.

- 6aa11f1: One sprite pool for the whole kit (T5.1f-g, spec 001). `game-vfx` gets `vfx.burst(kind, point, normal, count, speed?, options?)`, `vfx.spawn(...)`, `vfx.onLand(owner, fn)` and `vfx.sprites()` over 14 kinds (`data/sprite-kinds.json`, `patchSpriteKinds`; the numbers and the generator are the ones of the old `particles.ts`), with `floor` and `rise` spawn options; `game-vfx-three` draws them in two layers (`vfx-sprites-additive`, `vfx-sprites`). `game-destruction-three` and `game-fluids-three` delete their own `particles.ts` and use the pool (`ParticleKind` stays as an alias of `SpriteKind`; `FluidRendererOptions` gets `vfx` and `camera`; the destruction renderer plays the effects of the Phase 2 events through `eventEffects`, default `EVENT_EFFECTS_MAP`). `game-weapons-three` plays the muzzle flash and the casing of a shot seen from outside through `host.effects` (`muzzle_glock|ak|r870|barrett`, `casing_brass|shell|50`, by case type, in `data/world-effects.json`); the `shot` host event of `game-contracts` carries optional `origin` and `direction`, and the effect sink falls back from explosions to the Workshop recipes (`param` by index or id).

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 76ae86f: Chain reaction of explosives (A11). A part with `explodes.chain` is set off by a bullet, fire or a blast within reach and explodes after the delay of that trigger (fixed or drawn from the seed); the world emits `primed` and then `explode`, a part goes off once, blasts resolve in order of time and the delays count from the blast that armed the part, so the timeline does not depend on the `dt` of `update`. `explosivePart(explosive, part)` builds the part from an `ExplosiveDef` of `game-weapons` (fuel barrel, car tank, propane, pump, station tank). A bullet or a blast that would have destroyed such a part now arms it instead. `game-destruction-three` draws the fire of a part primed by a shot or fire.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1920f22: `DestructionRenderer.explode(point, energy, radius)` draws a blast that has no exploding part (flash, fire, smoke, light, sound and a shove on pieces in range). `world.explode` emits no event, so a grenade used to leave only debris; the test room now calls the new method when a thrown explosive detonates.

  `explode` is a new **required** member of the `DestructionRenderer` interface: any implementer of the interface (a custom renderer, a test double) must add it.

### Minor Changes

- 4573613: `bind` can now draw a part by a vertex range of a merged mesh: `BindOptions.parts` values also accept `{ mesh, range: [v0, v1] }` (new exported type `MeshRange`, alone or in an array with plain meshes). Dents, char and heat colours (through vertex colours), melt and hole/crack decals apply only to that range. When the part detaches, collapses (the renderer now also splits loose groups on `collapse` events) or breaks, its faces are extracted into a new mesh for the loose piece and the range is collapsed in the merged mesh; `restore` and `clear` bring everything back. Invalid ranges throw from `bind`.

- 308a258: Tall thin pieces (a door off a fridge) now topple instead of balancing on an edge: a narrow support gets a topple push and the piece does not sleep until it rests on a stable support.
- 2363a12: Fragments and debris of vertex-coloured meshes use the average vertex colour (cached per mesh) times `material.color` instead of coming out white.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1691ef2: New package `@adatechnology/game-contracts` (global `GameContracts`, no runtime dependencies): the destruction contract (`DestructibleImpl`, `IMPACT_CONTRACT`, `checkDestructible`, `checkHit`, hits, events, state), weapons (`Shot`, `Use`, `shotToHit`), fluids (`ContainerSpec`, `LiquidId`, `ItemUseDef`), item animations (`AnimationClipSpec`, `checkAnimation`) and the `TestableModule` a module hands the test room. The destruction, destruction-three, weapons, fluids and test-room packages depend on it and re-export the moved types, so existing imports keep working; their IIFE bundles now include the contracts. `game-test-room` gains `room.loadModule(module)` (items under the module group, scenarios as buttons, contract checks written to the log), `room.playAnimation` / `room.animations()` with an animations panel, and `TestRoomItem.impl` / `animations`. `game-destruction`: collapse events are computed after all losses (never for a broken part), brittle thin parts break from drops (`fragility`), and `checkDestructible` takes its material ids from the built-in table. `game-destruction-three`: `hardLanding` syncs the transform before the hit and `Piece.localCenter`. `game-fluids`: tap API (`addTap`, `setTap`, `removeTap`, `taps`, `tap` event).
- 0256a5b: Initial release (0.1.0): three.js renderer for `@adatechnology/game-destruction` with vertex dents, hole and crack decals, char and heat glow, melting and puddles, fragments, loose pieces with light physics and pooled particles, plus `specFromObject3D` and `heatColor`.
