# @adatechnology/game-destruction-three

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cb132c2: `userData.destructionPart` may be a string or an object `{ id, material?, parent?, kind? }` in `specFromObject3D` and `bind`; `parent` + `kind` add an explicit joint.
- 308a258: Tall thin pieces (a door off a fridge) now topple instead of balancing on an edge: a narrow support gets a topple push and the piece does not sleep until it rests on a stable support.
- 2363a12: Fragments and debris of vertex-coloured meshes use the average vertex colour (cached per mesh) times `material.color` instead of coming out white.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1691ef2: New package `@adatechnology/game-contracts` (global `GameContracts`, no runtime dependencies): the destruction contract (`DestructibleImpl`, `IMPACT_CONTRACT`, `checkDestructible`, `checkHit`, hits, events, state), weapons (`Shot`, `Use`, `shotToHit`), fluids (`ContainerSpec`, `LiquidId`, `ItemUseDef`), item animations (`AnimationClipSpec`, `checkAnimation`) and the `TestableModule` a module hands the test room. The destruction, destruction-three, weapons, fluids and test-room packages depend on it and re-export the moved types, so existing imports keep working; their IIFE bundles now include the contracts. `game-test-room` gains `room.loadModule(module)` (items under the module group, scenarios as buttons, contract checks written to the log), `room.playAnimation` / `room.animations()` with an animations panel, and `TestRoomItem.impl` / `animations`. `game-destruction`: collapse events are computed after all losses (never for a broken part), brittle thin parts break from drops (`fragility`), and `checkDestructible` takes its material ids from the built-in table. `game-destruction-three`: `hardLanding` syncs the transform before the hit and `Piece.localCenter`. `game-fluids`: tap API (`addTap`, `setTap`, `removeTap`, `taps`, `tap` event).
- 0256a5b: Initial release (0.1.0): three.js renderer for `@adatechnology/game-destruction` with vertex dents, hole and crack decals, char and heat glow, melting and puddles, fragments, loose pieces with light physics and pooled particles, plus `specFromObject3D` and `heatColor`.
