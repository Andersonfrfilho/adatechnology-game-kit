# @adatechnology/game-floorplan-structure

Structure pack for `@adatechnology/game-floorplan`: construction systems, the load path of every plan and its `DestructibleSpec`.

```ts
import { engine } from '@adatechnology/game-floorplan'
import { register } from '@adatechnology/game-floorplan-structure'

register(engine)
const plan = engine.generate('townhouse', { seed: 7 })
plan.structure.parts // the parts that carry load, each with role, material, box, mass
plan.structure.supports // what each part rests on, down to 'ground'
```

See `.claude/skills/game-floorplan-structure/SKILL.md` for the API and `MIGRATION.md` for the names the Visor de casas 3D used.
